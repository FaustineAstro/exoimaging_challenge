Direct imaging is the next big step in the hunt of extrasolar planets. Hereafter, we describe a community-wide data challenge for exoplanets direct detection and characterization with ground-based high-contrast imaging. 

## Scientific context

**Task: Exoplanet direct imaging for dummies here.**

## Motivation

There are currently multiple post-processing algorithms and pipelines for processing high contrast imaging data. As new algorithms are developed, it is important to test these algorithms on a library of standardized datasets for comparison with previous approaches.

Computer science and machine learning fields have a long tradition conducting data challenges and competitions. Repositories of benchmark (curated) datasets are an integral part of the field of machine learning. On the other hand, there are several frameworks for hosting and organizing data challenges, such as [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com).

 The goal of this challenge is not only to compare, in a fair and robust way, existing algorithms but to spark new collaborations/ideas, share knowledge, and ultimately to maximize the scientific return of existing and future near-infrared HCI instruments.
