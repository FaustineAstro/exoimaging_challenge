Direct imaging is the next big step in the hunt of extrasolar planets. Hereafter, we present a community-wide data challenge for exoplanets direct detection and characterization with ground-based high-contrast imaging. 

> The conditions of the challenge are *being* defined in collaboration with several renowned members of the high-contrast imaging community. 

## Science

Ground-based direct imaging of exoplanets is a challenging task. The main difficulties are the image degradation caused by the Earth's turbulent atmosphere, the huge difference in brightness between the host star and its potential companions (high-contrast imaging!), and the small angular separation between them. High-contrast imaging from the ground makes use of adaptive optics systems and coronagraphy. The following video, prepared by the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program, explain in simple terms the role of coronagraphy and adaptive optics with deformable mirrors in high-contrast imaging.

The two remaining components of high-contrast imaging are the data acquisition techniques ([see the sub-challenges section](pages/subchallenges.md)) and the post-processing techniques. The algorithms for post-processing of high-contrast imaging sequences are the focus of this data challenge.

## Motivation

There are currently multiple post-processing algorithms and pipelines for processing high contrast imaging data. As new algorithms are developed, it is important to test these algorithms on a library of standardized datasets for comparison with previous approaches.

Computer science and machine learning fields have a long tradition conducting data challenges and competitions. Repositories of benchmark (curated) datasets are an integral part of the field of machine learning. On the other hand, there are several frameworks for hosting and organizing data challenges, such as [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com).

 The goal of this challenge is not only to compare, in a fair and robust way, existing algorithms but to spark new collaborations/ideas, share knowledge, and ultimately to maximize the scientific return of existing and future near-infrared high-contrast imaging instruments.
