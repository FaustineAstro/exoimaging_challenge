Direct imaging is the next big step in the hunt of extrasolar planets. Hereafter, we present a community-wide data challenge for exoplanets direct detection with ground-based high-contrast imaging. 

> The conditions of the challenge are *being* defined in collaboration with several renowned members of the high-contrast imaging community. 

Direct observation of exoplanets using ground-based telescopes is a challenging task. The main difficulties are the huge difference in brightness between the host star and its potential companions, the small angular separation between them, and the image degradation caused by the Earth's turbulent atmosphere. Therefore, ground-based high-contrast imaging relies on the use of adaptive optics for wavefront correction and coronagraphy for the supression of the star light. The following video, prepared by the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program, explains in simple terms the role of coronagraphy and adaptive optics with deformable mirrors in high-contrast imaging.

The two remaining components of high-contrast imaging are the data acquisition techniques ([see the sub-challenges section](pages/subchallenges.md)) which focus on introducing some diversity in the data that later on can be exploited by the post-processing techniques. This last step of algorithmic speckle noise subtraction is what ultimately pushes the sensitivity of the exposures and the detection limits of surveys and instruments. 

## Objectives

A multitude of image processing algorithms and pipelines for processing high contrast imaging data have been developed in the past thirteen years. The goal of this challenge is not only to compare, in a fair and robust way, existing algorithms but to spark new collaborations/ideas, share knowledge, and ultimately to maximize the scientific return of existing and future near-infrared high-contrast imaging instruments.

Computer science and machine learning fields have a long tradition conducting data challenges and competitions. Repositories of benchmark (curated) datasets are an integral part of the field of machine learning. We want to integrate these practices to the field of high-contrast imaging. In the future, the process of testing new algorithms will be much straightforward and robust, once the community adopts the standard metrics (with their open-source implementations) and the benchmark library resulting from this challenge.
