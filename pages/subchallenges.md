This data challenge would focus on the most widely used observing techniques, pupil tracking and/or multi-spectral imaging (angular differential imaging and multi-channel spectral differential imaging). Detection and characterization of companions will be understood as independent tasks, with their own metrics and scoreboards.

**Task:** *Briefly explain the principles of the observing techniques.* 

**Task:** *Explain the data: 3d cubes for ADI and 4d cubes for ADI with an IFS.*
