The benchmark datasets shall be stored in a public space that ensures the long term preservation of data. The next generation of researchers shall be able to re-use the benchmark library for quick validation of novel algorithms. 

The datasets must be calibrated, or pre-processed, using the standard pipelines of each instrument, before entering the database. A complete description of the calibration procedures performed, and a link to the software used, will be attached to each datacube.
 
**Task: What infrastructure could we use to store the benchmark datasets associated with this challenge? NASA Exoplanet Archive, DIVA database, others?**

**Task: Which datasets will enter the benchmark database?**
