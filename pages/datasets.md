The benchmark datasets shall be stored in a public space that ensures the long term preservation of data. These datasets will be used in the context of this challenge as well as by the next generation of researchers, who will be able to re-use the benchmark library for quick validation of novel algorithms.

**Task:** *What infrastructure could we use to store the benchmark datasets associated with this challenge? NASA Exoplanet Archive, DIVA database, others?*

The datasets must be calibrated, or pre-processed, using the standard pipelines of each instrument, before entering the database ([Table](datasets_table)). A complete description of the calibration procedures performed, and a link to the software used, will be attached to each datacube.
 
**Task:** *Which datasets will enter the benchmark database ([Table](datasets_table))?*
