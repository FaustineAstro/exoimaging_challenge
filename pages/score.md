> TBD: Which framework are we using to host the challenge? We need easy online submission, creation of a leaderboard, among other things. 

[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is not well suited for this sort of challenges (their focus in on supervised learning problems).

[Codalab](http://codalab.org/) seems to be a good alternative. This option is being explored in collaboration with Rapahel Bacher from the Genoble Alpes Data Institute.
